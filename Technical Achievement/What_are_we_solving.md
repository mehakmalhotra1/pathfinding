# What are we solving-- Our Motivation for the Project

The main goal of our project is to create a Mars Curiosity Rover that can find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles on itâ€™s way.

We have tried to incorporate as many algorithms as we could so that the rover could use varied algorithms like A*,Dijkstra's,Greedy,Swarm etc to find the shortest path to its destination.

Not only does this web app allow dynamic and random creation of the start/end nodes and walls, but also enables the user to provide weights to random nodes 
and add stop-over's in the rovers path which it has to visit first before the end destination.

This makes our project unique and increases the problem solving capacity of the rover!
