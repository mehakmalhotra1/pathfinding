# What are we solving-- Our Motivation for the Project

The main goal of our project is to create a Mars Curiosity Rover that can find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles on itâ€™s way. 
We have tried to incorporate as many algorithms as we could so that the rover could use varied algorithms like A*,Dijkstra's,Greedy,Swarm etc to find the shortest path to its destination.

Not only does this web app allow dynamic and random creation of the start/end nodes and walls, but also enables the user to provide weights to random nodes and
add bomb(which can break the walls and need to be diffused first by the rover on its way to the destination) to the grid. 

This makes our project unique and increases the problem solving capacity of the rover!
